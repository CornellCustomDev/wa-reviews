**Report on Web Accessibility Review AI Project**

*Date: October 2023*

### Introduction

The Web Accessibility Review AI Project aimed to reduce the manual effort involved in web accessibility reviews by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to suggest applicable guidelines for identified accessibility issues. The project also sought to build in-house expertise in AI integration for future Custom Development projects. This report highlights the key outcomes, learnings, and proposed next steps from the project.

### Outcomes

1. **Development of an AI-Assisted Web Application:**
    - Successfully developed an initial web application prototype that integrates AI to map web accessibility issues to the relevant Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
    - The application allows users to input descriptions of accessibility issues, and the AI suggests applicable guidelines, provides remediation recommendations, and outlines testing procedures.

2. **Integration with Azure OpenAI Services:**
    - Utilized Azure OpenAI Studio and GPT models (including GPT-4 and GPT-3 variants) to process natural language inputs and generate guideline recommendations.
    - Experimented with "Bring Your Own Data" features to enhance AI's understanding of specific guidelines and internal documents.

3. **Rapid Prototyping and Iterative Development:**
    - Employed a rapid prototyping approach with short release cycles (R1 to R7), allowing for quick feedback and adjustments.
    - Incorporated user feedback from the Web Accessibility (WA) team, refining the application's functionality and user interface based on real-world testing.

4. **Enhanced User Interface and UX Considerations:**
    - Improved the application's user interface by introducing features like tagging, filtering, and a more organized layout for guidelines and issues.
    - Recognized the importance of UX design in making the tool accessible and efficient for both new and experienced users.

5. **Establishment of a Foundation for Future AI Projects:**
    - Built foundational knowledge and experience in AI integration, prompt engineering, and working with Large Language Models (LLMs).
    - Identified potential for AI to automate and enhance other areas of web accessibility testing and reporting.

### Learnings

1. **Effectiveness of AI in Accessibility Reviews:**
    - AI has the potential to significantly reduce the time required to map accessibility issues to relevant guidelines.
    - AI-assisted tools can provide consistent and comprehensive recommendations, aiding both novice and expert users.

2. **Challenges with AI Integration:**
    - Encountered complexities in using Azure OpenAI services, including limitations in the interface and resource management.
    - Learned that prompt engineering is critical for obtaining accurate and useful AI outputs.

3. **Importance of User Trust and Verification:**
    - Users expressed concerns about the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated recommendations.
    - Emphasized the need for mechanisms to verify AI outputs and allow for human oversight to build trust in the tool.

4. **Need for Comprehensive UX Design:**
    - A well-designed user interface is essential for user adoption and effectiveness.
    - Recognized that additional UX work is needed to make the tool intuitive and seamless within existing workflows.

5. **Resource and Time Considerations:**
    - Transitioning from a prototype to a fully functional tool requires significant additional resources.
    - Budgeting for AI services and tools (such as Flux UI components) needs careful planning.

### Next Steps

1. **Finalize the Experimental Phase:**
    - Conclude the current phase by compiling documentation, lessons learned, and a project report.
    - Share the outcomes with the broader team and stakeholders.

2. **Plan for Phase Two Development:**
    - Propose a second phase focused on refining the tool into a production-ready application.
    - Secure additional resources and budget for development, UX design, and AI services.

3. **Enhance User Interface and Experience:**
    - Engage in a dedicated UX design process to address usability issues and improve navigation.
    - Implement features such as comprehensive issue lists, visual indicators of progress, and better integration with existing tools like Siteimprove.

4. **Improve AI Accuracy and Reliability:**
    - Refine AI prompts and explore advanced models (e.g., GPT-4) to enhance the accuracy of recommendations.
    - Establish a feedback loop where users can report inaccuracies, allowing the system to improve over time.

5. **Increase Automation and Integration:**
    - Expand the number of automated checks by integrating additional ACT (Accessibility Conformance Testing) rules.
    - Work towards automating the identification of as many guidelines as possible while maintaining accuracy.

6. **Training and Adoption:**
    - Develop training materials to help users understand and effectively use the AI-assisted tool.
    - Encourage adoption by demonstrating the tool's benefits in reducing manual effort.

7. **Collaborate and Share Insights:**
    - Share findings and collaborate with other teams exploring AI integration, such as the AI team and external groups.
    - Consider presenting the project at conferences or internal demo days to showcase the innovation.

8. **Budget and Resource Planning:**
    - Evaluate the costs associated with AI services and tools to ensure sustainability.
    - Plan for long-term support and maintenance of the application.

### Conclusion

The Web Accessibility Review AI Project successfully demonstrated the potential of AI to enhance and streamline the web accessibility review process. The project provided valuable insights into the practicalities of AI integration, user experience design, and the importance of iterative development with stakeholder feedback. By addressing the identified challenges and building on the foundational work completed, there is significant opportunity to develop a robust tool that will benefit the accessibility team and the broader university community.
