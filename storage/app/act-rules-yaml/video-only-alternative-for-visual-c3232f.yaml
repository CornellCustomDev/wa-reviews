applicability: 'This rule applies to any non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `video` element that is [visible where the video does not contain audio.'
assumptions: "- A mechanism is available to start the video and the video element is not simply used to display the [poster](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#attr-video-poster).\n- The language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood."
accessibility_support: 'The HTML `video` element can also have a `track` element that provides an audio description. This should provide assistive technologies with a timed text description of visual information in a video. However, there is no native support in any major browser for this technique. Technique [H96: Using the track element to provide audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H96) can not be relied upon to conform to [1.2.1: Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded).'
