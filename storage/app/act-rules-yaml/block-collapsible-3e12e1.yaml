applicability: 'This rule applies to any HTML web page.'
assumptions: 'There are no assumptions.'
accessibility_support: 'There are no accessibility support issues known.'
background: 'Usually the same instrument removes both visibility and inclusion in the accessibility tree of a block of repeated content. That instrument may remove all blocks of repeated content. If there is no block of repeated content before the non-repeated content the rule passes.'
test_cases: {  }
expectation: "For each block of repeated content in each test target, which is before (in the flat tree) at least one node of non-repeated content after repeated content, all the following are true:\n\n- there exists an instrument to make all nodes in this block not visible; and\n- there exists an instrument to remove all nodes in this block from the accessibility tree."
