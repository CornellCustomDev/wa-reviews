applicability: "This rule applies to any visible character in a text node that is a child in the flat tree of an HTML element, except if the text node has an ancestor in the flat tree for which at least one of the following is true:\n\n- **disabled ancestor**: the ancestor is an inheriting semantic `group` or `widget` that is disabled; or\n- **disabled label**: the ancestor is used in the accessible name of an inheriting semantic `widget` that is disabled."
assumptions: "- Success criterion 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) has exceptions for \"incidental\" text, which includes inactive user interface components and decorative texts. The rule assumes that text nodes that should be ignored are disabled or hidden from assistive technologies. If this isn't the case, the text node could fail this rule while the success criterion could still be satisfied.\n\n- Success criterion 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) also has an exception for logos and brand names. Since logos and brand names are usually displayed through images to ensure correct rendering, this rule does not take logos or brand names into consideration. If a logo or brand name is included using text nodes, the text node could fail while the success criterion could still be satisfied.\n\n- Text that has the same foreground and background color (a contrast ratio of 1:1) is not considered to be \"visual presentation of text\", making it inapplicable to the success criterion. Text hidden in this way can still cause accessibility issues under other success criteria, depending on the content.\n\n- The definition of disabled element assumes that when the `aria-disabled` attribute is specified on an element, this element has also been disabled for users that do not rely on assistive technology. If this is not the case, that definition may produce incorrect results and in consequence this rule might be Inapplicable to some text nodes that still require a good contrast ratio."
accessibility_support: "- Different browsers have different levels of support for CSS. This can cause contrast issues in one browser that do not appear in another. Because of that, this rule can produce different results depending on the browser that is used. For example, a text that is positioned using CSS transform may be on a different background in a browser that does not support CSS transform.\n- Implementation of Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have a semantic role of `none` and fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue."
background: "Passing this rule does not mean that the text has sufficient color contrast. If all background pixels have a low contrast with all foreground pixels, the success criterion is guaranteed to not be satisfied. When some pixels have sufficient contrast, and others do not, legibility should be considered. There is no clear method for determining legibility when some but not all pixels have sufficient contrast, which is why passing this rule does not necessarily mean the corresponding success criterion is met.\n\nWhen the text color or background color is not specified in the web page, colors from other origins will be used. Testers must ensure colors are not affected by styles from a user origin, such as a custom style sheet. Contrast issues caused by specifying the text color but not the background or vice versa, must be tested separately from this rule.\n\nThis rule is closely related to success criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum). Because this rule is stricter, text that passes this rule will likely satisfy 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum).\n\n### Bibliography\n\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.6: Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html)\n- [G17: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G17)\n- [G18: Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G18)\n- [F83: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6 due to using background images that do not provide sufficient contrast with foreground text (or images of text)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F83)\n- [CSS Scoping Module Level 1 (Editor's Draft)](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/)"
