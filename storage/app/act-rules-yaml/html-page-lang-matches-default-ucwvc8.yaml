applicability: "This rule applies to any document element if it is an `html` element for which all of the following are true:\n\n- The document element has a `lang` attribute with a value that has a known primary language tag; and\n- The document element is in a top-level browsing context; and\n- The document element has a content type of `text/html`; and\n- The document element has a defined default page language."
assumptions: "- This rule assumes that the default human language of a page, as described in WCAG 2, can be determined by counting the number of words used in each language. If the default language needs to be derived in some other way (such as frequency analysis, mutual information based distance, â€¦), this rule may fail while [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#language-of-page) is still satisfied.\n\n- The language of the page can be set by other methods than the `lang` attribute, for example using HTTP headers or the `meta` element. These methods are not supported by all assistive technologies. This rule assumes that these other methods are insufficient to satisfying [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#language-of-page).\n\n- This rule assumes that user agents and assistive technologies can programmatically determine known primary language tags even if these do not conform to the RFC 5646 syntax.\n\n- This rule assumes that only known primary language tags are enough to satisfy Success Criterion 3.1.1 Language of Page; this notably excludes grandfathered tags and ISO 639.2 three-letters codes, both having poor support in assistive technologies.\n\n- This rule assumes that `iframe` title elements are not exposed to assistive technologies and so does not consider them as part of the default page language."
