applicability: 'This rule applies to any HTML or SVG element with a semantic role that defines its children to be presentational children.'
assumptions: 'This rule assumes that elements that are part of sequential focus navigation do not immediately blur, or move focus to another element. Such elements will fail this rule, but may still satisfy success criterion 4.1.2.'
accessibility_support: 'Several major browsers ignore the WAI-ARIA requirements on presentational children for most or sometimes all roles, or in presence of focusable content. Since some browsers implement presentational children while others do not, pages failing this rule may only be problematic with some browsers.'
background: "This rule applies to elements with a semantic role that defines its children to be presentational children, which are all of the following: `button`, `checkbox`, `img`, `meter`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`, `option`, `progressbar`, `radio`, `scrollbar`, `separator`, `slider`, `switch`, and `tab`.\n\nElements with a semantic role that has presentational children will not have any descendants in the accessibility tree. If any of those descendants are included in sequential focus navigation, this causes the focus to land on an element that has no corresponding node in the accessibility tree. The result is that there is no programmatic name or role available for assistive technologies. There are other problems that can come from presentational children too. These must be tested separately.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- [Element with aria-hidden has no focusable content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/6cfa84/)\n\n### Bibliography\n\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships)\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value)\n- WAI-ARIA 1.2 Presentational Children\n- [Element with aria-hidden has no focusable content](aria-hidden-no-focusable-content-6cfa84.md)"
