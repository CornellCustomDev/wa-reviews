applicability: "This rule applies to any HTML element that has visible children in the flat tree, and for which at least one of the following is true:\n\n- the element has a horizontal scroll distance greater than the computed left or right padding of the element; or\n- the element has a vertical scroll distance greater than the computed top or bottom padding of the element."
assumptions: 'This rule assumes that all scrollable elements with visible content need to be keyboard accessible. Scrollable elements that do not need to be keyboard accessible, perhaps because their content is purely decorative, the scroll area is whitespace, or because scroll can be controlled in some other keyboard accessible way such as through a button or custom scrollbar, may fail this rule but still satisfy success criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard.'
accessibility_support: "Some browsers will automatically make any scrollable element focusable to ensure keyboard accessibility. However, the browser does not include these elements in sequential focus navigation when it has a negative number as a tabindex attribute value.\n\nSome browsers restrict scrolling to the [content box](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-box-4/#content-box) of elements; while others allow to scroll the full [border box](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-box-4/#border-box), hence including the element's padding. This results in some elements being scrollable with a browser but not with another."
background: "To ensure there is some element from which arrow keys can be used to control the scroll position, focus must be on or in a scrollable region. If scripts are used to prevent the keyboard events from reaching the scrollable region, this could still cause a keyboard accessibility issue. This must be tested separately.\n\nThis rule only applies to elements who scroll content in the same document. Elements such as iframes that embed other documents may also be scrollable, but for them it is the embedded document that scrolls, not the content in the same document. Such scenarios are tested separately with rules such as [Iframe with negative tabindex has no interactive elements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/akn7bn/).\n\n### Bibliography\n\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html)\n- [G202: Ensuring keyboard control for all functionality](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G202)"
