    description: "This rule checks that a non-empty `lang` attribute of an element in the page has a language tag with a known primary language subtag.\n"
    accessibility_requirements: { 'wcag20:3.1.2': { forConformance: true, failed: 'not satisfied', passed: 'further testing needed', inapplicable: 'further testing needed' }, 'wcag-technique:H58': { forConformance: false, failed: 'not satisfied', passed: 'further testing needed', inapplicable: 'further testing needed' } }

    acknowledgments: { authors: ['Bryn Anderson', 'Jey Nandakumar'], funding: [WAI-Tools] }
applicability: "This rule applies to any HTML element with a `lang` attribute value that is not empty (`\"\"`) and for which all of the following is true:\n\n- **descendant**: the element is an inclusive descendant in the flat tree of a `body` element; and\n- **content type**: the element has an associated node document with a content type of `text/html`; and\n- **text**: there is some text inheriting its programmatic language from the element which is neither empty nor only whitespace."
assumptions: "- This rule assumes that the `lang` attribute value is used to indicate the language of a section of the content. If the `lang` attribute value is used for something else (for example to indicate the programming language of a `code` element), the content may still conform to WCAG despite failing this rule.\n\n- This rule assumes that user agents and assistive technologies can programmatically determine known primary language tags even if these do not conform to the RFC 5646 syntax.\n\n- This rule assumes that only known primary language tags are enough to satisfy Success Criterion 3.1.2 Language of Parts; this notably excludes grandfathered tags and ISO 639.2 three-letters codes, both having poor support in assistive technologies.\n\n- This rule assumes that the text nodes contain text that express something in human language and therefore need a correct programmatic language."
accessibility_support: 'There are differences in how assistive technologies handle unknown and invalid language tags. Some will default to the language of the page, whereas others will default to the closest ancestor with a valid lang attribute.'
