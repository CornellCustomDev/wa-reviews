The report below is a good overview of the project that we have just completed. However, it is written for a generalized audience and I would like to take an approach that fits better for the audiences I see:
- Leadership that helped approve funding for this AI experiment and would need to approve funding for future work based on it
- Developers on my web development team who have been eager to hear about this novel AI project

Instructions:
1. Help me specify the audiences that I might want to report to by giving me feedback and asking me questions until you and I agree that the audiences are well-defined.
2. After the audiences are defined, help me determine how best to communicate the project outcomes with each of the audiences by giving me feedback and asking me questions until you and I agree on the method and style of communication.
3. Craft the communication for one audience at a time, asking for feedback between audiences.

Overall: ask me clarifying questions until you are at least 95% certain that you can complete the task.

Here is the report:

## USER

Audience 1: Leadership. All are within our university central IT. This group includes my supervisor (development manager), my group leader (Assistant Director, Custom Development), her boss (Director, Enterprise Services), the head of IT (Chief information officer), a Director of Digital Innovation & Strategy (CIT executive leadership), the AI Solutions Architect (guiding AI experimental initiatives for university administration). The directors and executive leadership are interested in strategic opportunities for elevating IT services, mitigating risks related to adoption of AI (and non-adoption), coordination of AI initiatives, and consideration of return on investment. The leadership audience has some familiarity with AI and software development generally, so some technical details may be appropriate, particularly when those can be addressed within functional ideas like API integration. I want to make sure they understand that the experimental aspect of the project allowed for significant innovations and changes in during the project that had not been imagined at the outset.

Audience 2: Web development team. This team has very minimal experience with AI integration in code and has modest experience as users of AI-assisted code development. The team will be very interested in the technical implementation details and the approaches taken. The team will be interested in potential applications for future projects. The project used Azure OpenAI Studio and that will likely be the starting point for other projects for now. The project was completed using Laravel, but many of the developers work exclusively with Drupal and Wordpress, so they will be interested in how it could translate to their work. I hope to share knowledge with them and incite curiosity. I also want to be able to share the project process with them so they can be inspired to propose experimental projects of their own.

Other audiences: I can imagine giving a conference presentation about this, and I would want to meet the interests of product managers and developers in that kind of presentation.

Communication formats: For leadership, I will be giving a presentation over zoom in a few weeks. That should be a slide deck and a bit of interactive demo, with time and opportunity for discussion. I would like to supplement that with a written report geared more at my department head that can also be shared to upper leadership and others who are not directly aware of the project. For my development team, I'm also thinking a slide deck, but that will be a much more interactive demo and an opportunity to show code and have deeper discussion.

AUDIENCE 1 RESPONSES BELOW
Question: What are the most important outcomes from the project that you want to emphasize to the leadership?
- Innovation / unexpected developments: I'd like to demonstrate the different modalities of integration (in-app chat with context of page, directed outcome prompts with structured response for open ended problem, ability to assist in application design, ability to generate code I would not have attempted)
- Success of the project as an experiment: learning outcomes, insights for future directions, process
- Potential for follow-on efforts to organize and complete the application for production use
  Question: How does this project align with the strategic goals of the university's IT services?
- It helps us understand opportunities and limitations of using AI so that future decision-making can be informed
  Question: Do you want to address any challenges encountered and how they were mitigated?
- Yes, the AI accuracy is an important consideration
- The experimental approach was rich in idea generation and presentation, it was challenging to tie it all together at the end in the short timeframe
  Question: Are there recommendations or proposals for future work that you wish to present?
- Yes, we would like to take the results and re-focus on getting to a production-ready tool for managing and assisting our web accessibility projects
  Question: What key sections do you envision for the slide deck? I'd like to be a bit more creative with the slide deck, first presenting the opportunity we saw for AI to assist in what is otherwise a laborious process and the chance to build skills within our team for utilizing AI, next indicating how the project gave us opportunity and access to set up tooling we had not used before so that we could begin experimenting and learn how to utilize AI in a project, then utilizing that to give us results in the application, followed by using AI to take a completely novel approach based on the user feedback (have AI write complex code), and then getting AI to help write up the report and next steps. I expect that I will need to provide some context of the existing process and communicate how we see AI transforming that. And I expect to show how the new application can be utilized to get results. I think I didn't really answer the question.
  Question: Should the report be designed to stand alone, or primarily as a supplement to the presentation? It should stand alone.

I'm overwhelmed by the number of questions right now, so lets stay focused on Audience 1 and look at Audience 2 later.
