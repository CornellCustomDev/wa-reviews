assumptions: 'There are no assumptions.'
accessibility_support: 'There are no accessibility support issues known.'
background: "The presence of unknown ARIA attributes is often the result of a typo or other developer error. These attributes are ignored by browsers and other assistive technologies. This often means that a state or property which should exist is missing.\n\n### Bibliography\n\n- [ARIA in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#index-aria-global)\n- [WAI ARIA Supported States and Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#supportedState)\n- [G108: Using markup features to expose the name and role](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G108)\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value)\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value)\n- [Semantics and ARIA](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria/)"
