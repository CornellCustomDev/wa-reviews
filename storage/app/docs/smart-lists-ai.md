# AI Smart Lists

# Prompt 1
I’m writing a web app to assist people reviewing websites for meeting WCAG web accessibility criteria. Tools like SiteImprove are used to cover procedural criteria testing, but reviewers still need to manually test, especially for interactivity like keyboard, screen reader, and form submission. The manual effort includes determining which criteria to test on a page, reporting why that criteria is not being met, and how to remediate the issue. How would you go about making this manual effort faster with a web app that can utilize AI in the process?

# Response
To streamline the manual effort involved in WCAG compliance testing—particularly for interactive elements like keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and form submissions—you can leverage AI in your web app in several impactful ways:

1. **Automated Identification of Relevant WCAG Criteria**:
    - **Page Analysis**: Utilize AI to analyze the page's content and structure to determine which WCAG criteria are applicable. For instance, if the page contains forms, the AI can flag criteria related to form accessibility.
    - **Element Classification**: Implement computer vision and NLP techniques to classify page elements (buttons, links, forms) and map them to specific WCAG guidelines that require manual testing.

2. **AI-Assisted Issue Detection**:
    - **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning models trained on past accessibility issues to predict potential problem areas that need manual attention.
    - **User Interaction Simulation**: Develop AI agents that can simulate keyboard navigation or basic screen reader behavior to identify elements that might not be accessible.

3. **Interactive Testing Guidance**:
    - **Smart Checklists**: Provide dynamic checklists that adapt based on the page's content, guiding reviewers through only the relevant tests.
    - **Conversational AI Assistant**: Integrate a chatbot that can guide testers through manual tests, ask pertinent questions, and record their observations.

4. **Automated Reporting and Documentation**:
    - **Natural Language Generation**: Use AI to translate technical findings into clear, actionable reports. When a tester identifies an issue, the AI can help articulate why the criterion is not met and suggest remediation steps.
    - **Template Filling**: Implement AI to auto-fill report templates based on the data collected during testing, reducing the documentation burden on reviewers.

5. **Remediation Suggestions**:
    - **Best Practices Repository**: Build an AI-powered knowledge base that provides code snippets, design patterns, or third-party tool recommendations to fix identified issues.
    - **Contextual Recommendations**: The AI can offer remediation advice tailored to the specific technologies used on the page (e.g., React components, HTML5 elements).

6. **Collaborative Platform Features**:
    - **Issue Tracking Integration**: Automatically create tickets in issue-tracking systems (like Jira or GitHub Issues) with AI-generated summaries.
    - **Team Collaboration Tools**: Use AI to assign tasks to team members based on their expertise and past involvement with similar issues.

7. **Continuous Learning and Improvement**:
    - **Feedback Loops**: Allow the AI system to learn from the reviewers' inputs over time, improving its predictions and suggestions.
    - **Community Contributions**: Enable users to contribute to the AI's knowledge base, enhancing the system's ability to assist others.

8. **Accessibility Training Integration**:
    - **Micro-Learning Modules**: When an issue is detected, the AI can provide quick training snippets to educate testers or developers about the specific WCAG criteria.
    - **Certification Tracking**: Help organizations track their team's proficiency and training progress in accessibility standards.

By incorporating these AI-driven features into your web app, you can significantly reduce the time and effort required for manual WCAG compliance testing. This not only accelerates the review process but also enhances the accuracy and consistency of the results.

**Implementation Considerations**:

- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that any AI processing complies with data protection regulations, especially if analyzing user data or proprietary code.
- **Model Accuracy**: Continuously validate AI outputs with human oversight to maintain trust in the system.
- **User Experience**: Design the AI features to be intuitive and non-intrusive, enhancing the tester's workflow rather than complicating it.

By thoughtfully integrating AI, your web app can become a powerful tool that bridges the gap between automated checks and the nuanced needs of manual accessibility testing.

# Prompt 2
I’d like to work on the smart checklists based on the page analysis. I have the list of criteria that should be used for the checklists. I need a means for doing the page analysis. I can retrieve the html of the page. What approach should I take for having ai determine the applicable criteria? I’m writing my code in PHP using the Laravel framework. 

# Response
To determine the applicable WCAG criteria based on the HTML content of a page, you can combine rule-based analysis with AI techniques to create smart checklists dynamically. Below is an approach tailored for PHP using the Laravel framework:

---

### **1. Parse and Analyze the HTML Content**

**a. Retrieve the HTML:**

Since you can fetch the HTML of the page, start by retrieving and loading it into a DOM parser.

```php
$htmlContent = file_get_contents($url); // Or use cURL for more control
libxml_use_internal_errors(true); // Suppress HTML parsing errors
$dom = new \DOMDocument();
$dom->loadHTML($htmlContent);
libxml_clear_errors();
```

**b. Use DOM Parsing Libraries:**

Utilize PHP libraries like **DOMDocument** or **Symfony's DomCrawler** to navigate and analyze the HTML structure.

```php
use Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Crawler;

$crawler = new Crawler($htmlContent);
```

### **2. Identify Key Elements Related to WCAG Criteria**

**a. Create Mappings Between HTML Elements and WCAG Criteria:**

Develop a mapping of HTML elements, attributes, and patterns to specific WCAG criteria.

Example mapping:

- **Images (`<img>`) without `alt` attributes**: WCAG 1.1.1 (Non-text Content)
- **Form elements without labels**: WCAG 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)
- **Links without discernible text**: WCAG 2.4.4 (Link Purpose)

**b. Implement Rule-Based Checks:**

Write functions that traverse the DOM to check for these mappings.

```php
// Check for images without alt attributes
$images = $crawler->filter('img:not([alt])');
if ($images->count() > 0) {
    $applicableCriteria[] = 'WCAG 1.1.1 - Provide text alternatives for non-text content.';
}

// Check for form elements without labels
$formElements = $crawler->filter('input, select, textarea');
foreach ($formElements as $element) {
    $label = $crawler->filterXPath("//label[@for='{$element->getAttribute('id')}']");
    if ($label->count() === 0) {
        $applicableCriteria[] = 'WCAG 1.3.1 - Ensure that information and relationships are conveyed programmatically.';
        break;
    }
}
```

### **3. Integrate AI for Advanced Analysis**

**a. Utilize NLP for Text Content:**

For criteria involving language use, instructions, or content clarity, apply Natural Language Processing (NLP).

- **Option 1: Use PHP Libraries for NLP**

  While PHP isn't traditionally used for AI, libraries like [PHP-ML](https://php-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can perform basic ML tasks.

  ```php
  use Phpml\Classification\KNearestNeighbors;

  $samples = [...]; // Preprocessed text samples
  $labels = [...];  // Corresponding labels

  $classifier = new KNearestNeighbors();
  $classifier->train($samples, $labels);

  $result = $classifier->predict($newSample);
  ```

- **Option 2: Call External AI Services**

  Leverage AI APIs for more advanced NLP:

    - **OpenAI GPT-3/4**
    - **Google Cloud Natural Language API**
    - **Microsoft Azure Text Analytics**

  Example using Guzzle HTTP client:

  ```php
  $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
  $response = $client->post('https://api.openai.com/v1/completions', [
      'headers' => [
          'Authorization' => 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
          'Content-Type'  => 'application/json',
      ],
      'json' => [
          'model' => 'text-davinci-003',
          'prompt' => 'Analyze the following HTML for accessibility issues: ' . $htmlContent,
          'max_tokens' => 1500,
      ],
  ]);

  $analysis = json_decode($response->getBody(), true);
  ```

**b. Handle AI Responses:**

Parse the AI's response to extract applicable WCAG criteria.

```php
$applicableCriteriaFromAI = $analysis['choices'][0]['text'];
// Process and add to your criteria list
```

### **4. Generate Smart Checklists**

**a. Consolidate Criteria:**

Merge the criteria identified through rule-based checks and AI analysis, removing duplicates.

```php
$applicableCriteria = array_unique($applicableCriteria);
```

**b. Create the Checklist:**

Present the criteria in a user-friendly format for the reviewer.

```php
foreach ($applicableCriteria as $criterion) {
    echo "- [ ] " . $criterion . "\n";
}
```

**c. Integrate with Laravel Views:**

Pass the criteria to your Blade template.

```php
return view('checklist', ['criteria' => $applicableCriteria]);
```

In your Blade template:

```blade
@foreach ($criteria as $criterion)
    <li><input type="checkbox"> {{ $criterion }}</li>
@endforeach
```

### **5. Provide Remediation Guidance**

**a. Link Criteria to Solutions:**

For each criterion, offer explanations and remediation steps.

```php
$remediationGuidance = [
    'WCAG 1.1.1' => 'Add meaningful alt text to all images.',
    'WCAG 1.3.1' => 'Ensure all form elements have associated labels.',
    // Add more as needed
];

foreach ($applicableCriteria as $criterion) {
    $guidance = $remediationGuidance[$criterion] ?? 'No guidance available.';
    // Display or store the guidance
}
```

### **6. Optional: Use Machine Learning Models**

If you want to implement more advanced AI:

**a. Train a Model in Python:**

Because PHP lacks robust AI libraries, consider training a model in Python using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

**b. Create a Microservice:**

Expose your Python model via a REST API using Flask or FastAPI.

```python
# Python Flask example
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    html_content = request.json['html']
    # Perform analysis
    return jsonify({'criteria': predicted_criteria})
```

**c. Call the Python Service from PHP:**

Use Guzzle or cURL to send HTTP requests.

```php
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
$response = $client->post('http://localhost:5000/predict', [
    'json' => ['html' => $htmlContent],
]);
$predictedCriteria = json_decode($response->getBody(), true)['criteria'];
```

### **7. Implementation Considerations**

**a. Data Privacy:**

- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- If sending data to external services, anonymize it if necessary.

**b. Performance:**

- Cache results where appropriate.
- Consider asynchronous processing for long-running tasks.

**c. Maintenance:**

- Keep your mappings and AI models updated with the latest WCAG guidelines.
- Regularly retrain AI models with new data for better accuracy.

### **8. Additional Tools and Resources**

**PHP Libraries:**

- **DOMDocument**: Native PHP extension for DOM manipulation.
- **Symfony DomCrawler**: More advanced HTML parsing.
- **Guzzle**: HTTP client for API requests.
- **PHP-ML**: Machine Learning library for PHP.

**AI Services:**

- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Advanced language understanding.
- **Google Cloud NLP**: Text analysis capabilities.
- **Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services**: Variety of AI tools.

**Python AI Frameworks (if integrating Python):**

- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For building ML models.
- **Flask/FastAPI**: For creating RESTful APIs.

---

By following this approach, you can create a dynamic system that analyzes web pages, determines the applicable WCAG criteria, and assists reviewers with smart checklists and remediation guidance. This will significantly speed up the manual effort required for accessibility testing.

### **Example Workflow**

1. **User Input**: Reviewer inputs the URL or uploads HTML content.
2. **HTML Retrieval**: System fetches and parses the HTML.
3. **Rule-Based Analysis**: Immediate checks for known patterns.
4. **AI Analysis**: For complex content, AI services are invoked.
5. **Criteria Mapping**: Findings are mapped to WCAG criteria.
6. **Checklist Generation**: Smart checklist is presented to the reviewer.
7. **Remediation Guidance**: For each item, guidance is provided.
8. **Reporting**: Results are compiled into a report for stakeholders.

### **Final Thoughts**

- **Iterative Development**: Start with rule-based analysis and gradually integrate AI components.
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve the system over time.
- **Community Resources**: Leverage existing accessibility tools and datasets to enhance your application.

By integrating these techniques into your Laravel application, you'll create a powerful tool that not only speeds up the manual review process but also enhances the accuracy and thoroughness of accessibility testing.

# Prompt 3
Think through how to get all of the data from WCAG ACT examples and use that to generate rule sets

# Response
Certainly! Leveraging the **WCAG ACT (Accessibility Conformance Testing) Rules** can significantly enhance your application's ability to generate accurate and comprehensive rule sets for accessibility testing. Here's how you can obtain all the data from WCAG ACT examples and use it to generate rule sets within your Laravel application:

---

### **1. Access the WCAG ACT Rules Data**

**a. Official Repository:**

- The **ACT Rules** are maintained by the W3C ACT Rules Community Group.
- Visit the [ACT Rules Community GitHub Repository](https://github.com/act-rules/act-rules.github.io) to access all the rules and examples.

**b. Data Format:**

- The rules are provided in a structured format, primarily in **Markdown (`.md`)** and **JSON (`.json`)** files.
- Each rule includes details like **applicability**, **expectations**, **test cases**, and **examples**.

### **2. Clone or Download the Repository**

**a. Clone the Repository Using Git:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/act-rules/act-rules.github.io.git
```

**b. Download as ZIP:**

- If you prefer not to use Git, you can download the repository as a ZIP file directly from GitHub.

### **3. Parse and Extract Rule Data**

**a. Parsing Markdown Files:**

- Use a **Markdown parser** in PHP to read and extract content.

  ```php
  use Parsedown;

  $parsedown = new Parsedown();
  $ruleFiles = glob('path/to/rules/*.md');

  foreach ($ruleFiles as $file) {
      $markdownContent = file_get_contents($file);
      $htmlContent = $parsedown->text($markdownContent);
      // Process $htmlContent as needed
  }
  ```

- **Parsedown** is a popular PHP library for parsing Markdown.

**b. Parsing JSON Files:**

- Some data may be in JSON format, which can be decoded using `json_decode`.

  ```php
  $jsonContent = file_get_contents('path/to/rule.json');
  $ruleData = json_decode($jsonContent, true);
  ```

### **4. Extract Relevant Information**

**a. Key Sections to Extract:**

- **Rule ID and Name**
- **Description**
- **Applicability**
- **Expectations**
- **Test Cases** (Passed, Failed, Inapplicable Examples)
- **WCAG References**

**b. Example of Extracting Applicability and Expectations:**

```php
// Assuming $ruleData contains the JSON-decoded data
$applicability = $ruleData['applicability'];
$expectations = $ruleData['expectations'];
$testCases = $ruleData['test_cases'];
```

### **5. Map ACT Rules to Your Application's Rule Sets**

**a. Create a Data Structure for Rules:**

- Define a PHP class or data structure that represents a rule.

  ```php
  class AccessibilityRule {
      public $id;
      public $name;
      public $description;
      public $applicability;
      public $expectations;
      public $testCases;
      public $wcagReferences;
  }
  ```

**b. Instantiate Rules from Extracted Data:**

  ```php
  $rule = new AccessibilityRule();
  $rule->id = $ruleData['id'];
  $rule->name = $ruleData['name'];
  $rule->description = $ruleData['description'];
  $rule->applicability = $ruleData['applicability'];
  $rule->expectations = $ruleData['expectations'];
  $rule->testCases = $ruleData['test_cases'];
  $rule->wcagReferences = $ruleData['accessibility_requirements'];
  ```

### **6. Generate Rule Logic Based on Examples**

**a. Understand Test Cases:**

- **Passed Examples:** Code samples that meet the criterion.
- **Failed Examples:** Code samples that violate the criterion.
- **Inapplicable Examples:** Code samples where the rule doesn't apply.

**b. Use Examples to Derive Conditions:**

- Analyze failed examples to understand what causes non-compliance.
- Translate these findings into conditional checks in your code.

**c. Example: Generating a Rule for `img` Elements Without `alt` Attributes**

```php
function ruleImageAlt($dom) {
    $images = $dom->getElementsByTagName('img');
    $violations = [];

    foreach ($images as $img) {
        if (!$img->hasAttribute('alt') || empty(trim($img->getAttribute('alt')))) {
            $violations[] = $img;
        }
    }

    return $violations;
}
```

### **7. Automate Rule Generation**

**a. Create a Rule Engine:**

- Develop a system that can interpret rule definitions and execute corresponding checks.

**b. Use a Configuration File:**

- Store rule logic in configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) that your application can read and interpret.

  ```yaml
  - id: "1.1.1"
    element: "img"
    attribute: "alt"
    condition: "attribute_missing_or_empty"
    wcag_reference: "WCAG 1.1.1"
  ```

**c. Implement a Parser for the Configuration:**

  ```php
  $rulesConfig = yaml_parse_file('path/to/rules.yml');

  foreach ($rulesConfig as $config) {
      // Implement logic based on $config
  }
  ```

### **8. Integrate Rules into Smart Checklists**

**a. Dynamically Generate Checklists:**

- Use the applicability conditions from the rules to determine which criteria apply to the page being analyzed.

  ```php
  $applicableCriteria = [];

  // Example DOMDocument instance
  $dom = new \DOMDocument();
  @$dom->loadHTML($htmlContent);

  foreach ($rules as $rule) {
      if (isRuleApplicable($rule->applicability, $dom)) {
          $applicableCriteria[] = $rule;
      }
  }
  ```

**b. Define the `isRuleApplicable` Function:**

- Implement logic to evaluate the applicability conditions.

  ```php
  function isRuleApplicable($applicability, $dom) {
      // Parse and evaluate the applicability expression
      // This could involve checking for specific elements or attributes
  }
  ```

### **9. Provide Detailed Feedback and Remediation Guidance**

**a. Use Expectations and Test Cases:**

- When a rule is violated, present the expectation and reference the failed test cases to help users understand the issue.

**b. Link to Official Documentation:**

- Provide links to the specific WCAG guidelines and ACT Rule pages for additional context.

**c. Example Feedback:**

  ```php
  foreach ($violations as $violation) {
      echo "Element <" . $violation->nodeName . "> violates rule " . $rule->id . ": " . $rule->name . "\n";
      echo "Description: " . $rule->description . "\n";
      echo "Recommendation: " . $rule->expectations[0]['description'] . "\n";
      echo "WCAG Reference: " . implode(', ', array_keys($rule->wcagReferences)) . "\n";
  }
  ```

### **10. Keep Your Rule Sets Updated**

**a. Automate Updates:**

- Set up a cron job or scheduled task to pull the latest changes from the ACT Rules repository.

  ```bash
  cd path/to/act-rules.github.io
  git pull origin main
  ```

**b. Monitor Changes:**

- Keep an eye on updates to the WCAG guidelines and ACT Rules to ensure your rule sets remain current.

### **11. Legal and Licensing Considerations**

**a. Review Licensing Terms:**

- The ACT Rules are typically shared under the [W3C Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/doc-license).

- Ensure your use complies with these terms, especially if your application is commercial.

### **12. Consider Performance Optimizations**

**a. Caching Mechanisms:**

- Cache parsed rules and results to improve performance.

**b. Asynchronous Processing:**

- For large pages or complex analyses, consider queueing jobs using Laravel's queue system.

### **13. Enhance with Machine Learning (Optional)**

**a. Use Machine Learning for Complex Patterns:**

- For patterns that are hard to define with rule-based logic, ML can help identify issues based on training data from the examples.

**b. Integrate Python Scripts:**

- Since PHP isn't ideal for ML, you can write Python scripts and call them from PHP.

  ```php
  $output = shell_exec('python3 path/to/script.py ' . escapeshellarg($htmlContent));
  $mlResults = json_decode($output, true);
  ```

**c. Use ML Libraries:**

- Python offers libraries like **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch** for machine learning tasks.

### **14. Document Your Rule Sets and Processes**

**a. Maintain Clear Documentation:**

- Keep records of how each rule is implemented and any deviations from the ACT Rule definitions.

**b. Facilitate Collaboration:**

- If working in a team, ensure everyone understands how rules are generated and applied.

---

By systematically extracting and utilizing data from the WCAG ACT examples, you'll be able to:

- **Create comprehensive rule sets** that reflect the latest accessibility standards.
- **Automate the generation of smart checklists**, making the manual review process faster and more efficient.
- **Provide detailed feedback and remediation guidance**, helping users understand and fix accessibility issues.

This approach not only enhances the functionality of your web app but also ensures that it remains aligned with official guidelines and best practices.

If you need further assistance in implementing any of these steps or have additional questions, feel free to ask!


# Prompt 4
I've done steps 1-5, help me do step 7, "Automate Rule Generation", "Create a rule engine".

# Response
Certainly! Let's focus on **Step 7: Automate Rule Generation by Creating a Rule Engine**. Building a rule engine will allow your application to interpret rule definitions dynamically and execute corresponding checks against web pages. Here's how you can approach this:

---

### **Overview**

A rule engine is a system that:

1. **Interprets Rule Definitions**: Reads rule definitions from a structured format (like JSON or YAML).
2. **Executes Rules**: Applies these rules to the data (HTML content) to identify accessibility issues.
3. **Generates Results**: Provides outputs such as detected issues, applicable criteria, and remediation steps.

---

### **Steps to Create a Rule Engine**

1. **Define the Rule Format**: Decide on a structured format for your rules (e.g., JSON or YAML).
2. **Implement Rule Parsing**: Write code to read and parse the rules from your chosen format.
3. **Create the Rule Engine Core**: Develop the core system that can interpret and execute the rules.
4. **Design Rule Evaluation Logic**: Define how each rule's conditions are evaluated against the DOM.
5. **Handle Rule Outcomes**: Collect and present the results of rule evaluations.
6. **Optimize and Extend**: Ensure the engine is efficient and can be extended with new rules.

Let's delve into each step with code examples and explanations.

---

### **1. Define the Rule Format**

Use a structured format like JSON or YAML to represent your rules, making them easy to parse and modify.

**Example Rule in JSON:**

```json
{
  "id": "1.1.1",
  "name": "Non-text Content",
  "description": "All non-text content must have a text alternative.",
  "selector": "img",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "attribute": "alt",
      "operator": "exists",
      "negate": false
    },
    {
      "attribute": "alt",
      "operator": "not_empty",
      "negate": false
    }
  ],
  "wcag_reference": "WCAG 1.1.1",
  "severity": "error"
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the rule.
- **`name`**: Name of the rule.
- **`description`**: Detailed explanation.
- **`selector`**: CSS selector to find relevant elements.
- **`conditions`**: Conditions to evaluate on each element.
- **`wcag_reference`**: Associated WCAG criterion.
- **`severity`**: Level of importance (e.g., error, warning).

---

### **2. Implement Rule Parsing**

In your Laravel application, read and parse the rule definitions.

**Parsing JSON Rules:**

```php
$rulesJson = file_get_contents(storage_path('rules/rules.json'));
$rules = json_decode($rulesJson, true);
```

**Parsing YAML Rules (Optional):**

Install the YAML parser:

```bash
composer require symfony/yaml
```

Then parse the YAML file:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Yaml\Yaml;

$rules = Yaml::parseFile(storage_path('rules/rules.yaml'));
```

---

### **3. Create the Rule Engine Core**

Develop a class that manages rule execution.

**Rule Engine Class:**

```php
class RuleEngine
{
    protected $rules;
    protected $dom;

    public function __construct(array $rules)
    {
        $this->rules = $rules;
    }

    public function execute($htmlContent)
    {
        // Load HTML into DOM
        $this->dom = new \DOMDocument();
        @$this->dom->loadHTML($htmlContent);

        $results = [];

        foreach ($this->rules as $ruleData) {
            $rule = new Rule($ruleData);
            $violations = $rule->evaluate($this->dom);
            if (!empty($violations)) {
                $results[] = [
                    'rule' => $rule,
                    'violations' => $violations,
                ];
            }
        }

        return $results;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `RuleEngine` class accepts an array of rules.
- The `execute` method processes each rule against the provided HTML content.
- Violations are collected for reporting.

---

### **4. Design Rule Evaluation Logic**

Create a `Rule` class that knows how to evaluate itself.

**Rule Class:**

```php
class Rule
{
    public $id;
    public $name;
    public $description;
    public $selector;
    public $conditions;
    public $wcagReference;
    public $severity;

    public function __construct(array $ruleData)
    {
        $this->id = $ruleData['id'];
        $this->name = $ruleData['name'];
        $this->description = $ruleData['description'];
        $this->selector = $ruleData['selector'];
        $this->conditions = $ruleData['conditions'];
        $this->wcagReference = $ruleData['wcag_reference'];
        $this->severity = $ruleData['severity'];
    }

    public function evaluate(\DOMDocument $dom)
    {
        $elements = $this->getElements($dom);
        $violations = [];

        foreach ($elements as $element) {
            if (!$this->checkConditions($element)) {
                $violations[] = $this->getElementInfo($element);
            }
        }

        return $violations;
    }

    protected function getElements(\DOMDocument $dom)
    {
        // Use Symfony's CssSelector component to convert CSS selectors to XPath
        $converter = new \Symfony\Component\CssSelector\CssSelectorConverter();
        $xpathExpr = $converter->toXPath($this->selector);
        $xpath = new \DOMXPath($dom);
        return $xpath->query($xpathExpr);
    }

    protected function checkConditions(\DOMElement $element)
    {
        foreach ($this->conditions as $condition) {
            $attribute = $condition['attribute'];
            $operator = $condition['operator'];
            $negate = $condition['negate'];

            $result = $this->evaluateCondition($element, $attribute, $operator);

            if ($negate) {
                $result = !$result;
            }

            if (!$result) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    protected function evaluateCondition(\DOMElement $element, $attribute, $operator)
    {
        $attributeValue = ($attribute === 'textContent') ? $element->textContent : $element->getAttribute($attribute);

        switch ($operator) {
            case 'exists':
                return $element->hasAttribute($attribute);
            case 'not_empty':
                return trim($attributeValue) !== '';
            case 'equals':
                return $attributeValue === $condition['value'];
            case 'contains':
                return strpos($attributeValue, $condition['value']) !== false;
            case 'matches':
                return preg_match($condition['value'], $attributeValue) === 1;
            default:
                throw new \Exception("Unknown operator: $operator");
        }
    }

    protected function getElementInfo(\DOMElement $element)
    {
        // Collect information about the element for reporting
        return [
            'tag' => $element->tagName,
            'attributes' => iterator_to_array($element->attributes),
            'outerHTML' => $this->getOuterHTML($element),
        ];
    }

    protected function getOuterHTML(\DOMElement $element)
    {
        $dom = new \DOMDocument();
        $dom->appendChild($dom->importNode($element, true));
        return $dom->saveHTML();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Rule` class encapsulates rule data and evaluation logic.
- The `evaluate` method applies the rule to the DOM and collects violations.
- The `getElements` method uses CSS selectors to find relevant elements.
- The `evaluateCondition` method checks if an element meets the rule's conditions.

**Note:** Install the CssSelector component:

```bash
composer require symfony/css-selector
```

---

### **5. Handle Rule Outcomes**

Collect violations and prepare them for presentation.

**Processing Results:**

```php
$ruleEngine = new RuleEngine($rules);
$results = $ruleEngine->execute($htmlContent);

foreach ($results as $result) {
    $rule = $result['rule'];
    $violations = $result['violations'];

    echo "Rule Violated: {$rule->id} - {$rule->name}\n";
    echo "Description: {$rule->description}\n";
    echo "WCAG Reference: {$rule->wcagReference}\n";
    echo "Severity: {$rule->severity}\n";
    echo "Violations:\n";

    foreach ($violations as $violation) {
        echo "Tag: {$violation['tag']}\n";
        echo "Attributes:\n";
        foreach ($violation['attributes'] as $attrName => $attrNode) {
            echo " - {$attrName}: {$attrNode->value}\n";
        }
        echo "HTML Snippet:\n";
        echo htmlspecialchars($violation['outerHTML']) . "\n";
        echo "\n";
    }
    echo "---------------------------------\n";
}
```

---

### **6. Optimize and Extend**

**Adding More Conditions and Operators:**

Extend the `evaluateCondition` method to support additional operators like `greater_than`, `less_than`, `regex`, etc.

**Example Condition with Value:**

In your rule definition:

```json
{
  "id": "2.4.2",
  "name": "Page Titled",
  "description": "Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose.",
  "selector": "head > title",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "attribute": "textContent",
      "operator": "not_empty",
      "negate": false
    }
  ],
  "wcag_reference": "WCAG 2.4.2",
  "severity": "error"
}
```

**Implementing Complex Conditions:**

For rules requiring more complex logic, you can introduce a scripting language or callbacks, but this can complicate your engine. Alternatively, you can handle such cases with custom code.

---

### **7. Integrate with Your Laravel Application**

**Service Class:**

Create a service class for accessibility checking.

```php
namespace App\Services;

use App\RuleEngine;

class AccessibilityChecker
{
    protected $ruleEngine;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $rulesJson = file_get_contents(storage_path('rules/rules.json'));
        $rules = json_decode($rulesJson, true);
        $this->ruleEngine = new RuleEngine($rules);
    }

    public function analyze($htmlContent)
    {
        return $this->ruleEngine->execute($htmlContent);
    }
}
```

**Controller Method:**

```php
public function analyze(Request $request)
{
    $url = $request->input('url');
    $htmlContent = file_get_contents($url);

    $checker = new \App\Services\AccessibilityChecker();
    $results = $checker->analyze($htmlContent);

    return view('results', compact('results'));
}
```

**Blade View (`results.blade.php`):**

```blade
@foreach ($results as $result)
    <h2>{{ $result['rule']->id }} - {{ $result['rule']->name }}</h2>
    <p>{{ $result['rule']->description }}</p>
    <p><strong>WCAG Reference:</strong> {{ $result['rule']->wcagReference }}</p>
    <p><strong>Severity:</strong> {{ ucfirst($result['rule']->severity) }}</p>
    <h3>Violations:</h3>
    @foreach ($result['violations'] as $violation)
        <div class="violation">
            <p><strong>Tag:</strong> {{ $violation['tag'] }}</p>
            <p><strong>Attributes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                @foreach ($violation['attributes'] as $attrName => $attrNode)
                    <li>{{ $attrName }}: {{ $attrNode->value }}</li>
                @endforeach
            </ul>
            <p><strong>HTML Snippet:</strong></p>
            <pre>{{ $violation['outerHTML'] }}</pre>
        </div>
    @endforeach
    <hr>
@endforeach
```

### **Additional Considerations**

**Error Handling:**

- Ensure your rule engine handles exceptions gracefully.
- Validate your rule definitions to prevent parsing errors.

**Performance Optimization:**

- For large HTML documents, optimize the selection and evaluation methods.
- Cache frequently used data if necessary.

**Extensibility:**

- Keep your rule definitions separate from code for easy updates.
- Allow the addition of new rules without modifying the engine core.

**Testing:**

- Write unit tests for your rule engine and rule evaluations.
- Test with various HTML samples to ensure accuracy.

---

### **Example Rule Definitions**

**Rule for `aria-label` on interactive elements:**

```json
{
  "id": "4.1.2",
  "name": "Name, Role, Value",
  "description": "Interactive elements should have accessible names.",
  "selector": "button, [role='button'], a[href], input, textarea, select",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "attribute": "aria-label",
      "operator": "not_empty",
      "negate": false
    },
    {
      "attribute": "aria-labelledby",
      "operator": "not_empty",
      "negate": false
    },
    {
      "attribute": "textContent",
      "operator": "not_empty",
      "negate": false
    }
  ],
  "condition_logic": "any",  // Custom field to indicate 'any' condition must pass
  "wcag_reference": "WCAG 4.1.2",
  "severity": "warning"
}
```

**Modifying `checkConditions` to Handle Logic Operators:**

```php
protected function checkConditions(\DOMElement $element)
{
    $logic = $this->condition_logic ?? 'all';
    $results = [];

    foreach ($this->conditions as $condition) {
        $attribute = $condition['attribute'];
        $operator = $condition['operator'];
        $negate = $condition['negate'];

        $result = $this->evaluateCondition($element, $attribute, $operator);

        if ($negate) {
            $result = !$result;
        }

        $results[] = $result;

        if ($logic === 'any' && $result) {
            return true;
        } elseif ($logic === 'all' && !$result) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return $logic === 'all' ? true : false;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `condition_logic` field indicates whether **all** conditions must pass or **any** condition is sufficient.
- The `checkConditions` method is updated to handle this logic.

---

### **Final Thoughts**

By creating a rule engine, you've built a flexible system that can:

- Dynamically apply rules defined in external files.
- Be extended with new rules and conditions.
- Provide detailed reports on accessibility issues.

This approach keeps your code clean and maintainable while allowing you to adapt to changes in accessibility standards.
