applicability: 'This rule applies to every non-streaming](#non-streaming-media-element) `video` element that is [visible, where the video contains audio.'
assumptions: "- This rule assumes that the video element is used to play synchronized media (video with audio), and that there is a mechanism to start the media.\n- This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood."
accessibility_support: 'There are no accessibility support issues known.'
