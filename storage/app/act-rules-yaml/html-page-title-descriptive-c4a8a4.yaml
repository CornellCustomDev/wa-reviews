applicability: "This rule applies to the document title of each html web page, except if one of the following is true:\n\n- The html web page has no document title; or\n- The document title contains only [whitespace](#whitespace) [text nodes](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#text)."
assumptions: 'There are currently no assumptions.'
accessibility_support: '- This rule assumes that browsers only recognize the first `title` element if multiple `title` elements are present in the [document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document). Testing shows that this in general is the case. Therefore the scope of this rule is limited to only checking the first `title` element in a document.'
background: "The `title` elements of embedded documents, such as those in `iframe`, `object`, or `svg` elements, are not applicable because those are not web pages according to the definition in WCAG.\n\nThe [HTML specification - The `title` element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-title-element) requires documents to only have one `title` element; and `title` elements to be children of the `head` element of a document. However, current HTML specification also describes what should happen in case of multiple titles, and titles outside the `head` element. Because of this, neither of these validation issues causes a conformance problem for WCAG.\n\n### Related rules\n\n- [HTML page has non-empty title](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/2779a5/)\n\n### Bibliography\n\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.2: Page titled](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/page-titled.html)\n- [Technique G88: Providing descriptive titles for Web pages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G88)\n- [Technique H25: Providing a title using the title element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H25)"
