# WA Reviews Project Overview

## Introduction
WA Reviews is a web application designed for completing and managing Cornell Web Accessibility reviews. The application helps ensure that web content meets accessibility standards by providing tools for review, issue tracking, and reporting. It is an implementation of [Cornell's WCAG testing guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16b77RZcTL0bWZXTkMgJNd0rfkrv-x83jktacVB8NY-U/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.oab37tgoxnuc) and checklist.

## Project Purpose
The primary purpose of this application is to streamline the process of conducting web accessibility reviews at Cornell University. It provides a structured approach to identifying, documenting, and resolving accessibility issues across web properties.

## Key Features
1. **Project Management**
   - Create and manage accessibility review projects
   - Track project status and progress
   - Generate accessibility reports

2. **Team Collaboration**
   - Team-based access control
   - Collaborative review workflows
   - Role-based permissions

3. **Issue Tracking**
   - Document accessibility issues
   - Categorize issues by scope and severity
   - Track issue resolution progress

4. **Accessibility Guidelines**
   - Reference to accessibility standards and guidelines
   - Categorized criteria for evaluation
   - ACT rules, SIA rules, and Siteimprove rules integration

5. **AI Assistance**
   - AI-powered chat for accessibility questions
   - Page analysis tools
   - Automated suggestions
   - AI agents with specialized tools for accessibility analysis

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend**: Livewire components using FluxUI and Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Cornell SSO integration via Apache mod_shib
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB
- **AI Integration**: Cornell AI API Gateway with LarAgent and OpenAI
- **Permissions**: Laratrust library for role-based access control
- **Data Import/Export**: Laravel Excel for spreadsheet handling

## Project Structure
The application follows a standard Laravel project structure with:
- Livewire components for UI interactions
- Models for data representation
- Controllers and routes for request handling
- Policies for authorization
- Migrations for database schema management

## Workflow Process
The application follows a specific workflow for accessibility reviews:

1. **Create a Project**: Start by creating a new review project from the Projects page or from a Team's Projects page.
   - Projects can be set up like creating a new WA Checklist
   - Data can be imported via the Upload button

2. **Add Scope**: Define the scope of the review on the Project page.
   - Add scope items via the Scope tab
   - Import scopes from a spreadsheet checklist using the standard sheets format

3. **Assign Reviewer**: In the Workflow panel, assign the project to a reviewer and update status to Start Review.

4. **Add Issues**: Document accessibility issues via the Issues tab on the Project page or from a Scope page.
   - Add observations manually
   - Use AI to suggest observations (must be approved to be included in reports)

5. **Complete and Report**: Fill out report fields, update status to Complete Review, and view the report.
   - Add read-only viewers via the Report Viewers panel

## Team Structure
The application uses a team-based approach to manage access:

- **Site Admins**: Create teams and manage system-wide settings
- **Team Admins**: Manage team users and projects
- **Reviewers**: Work on assigned projects
- **Report Viewers**: Have read-only access to specific reports

## Architectural Patterns
The application follows several key architectural patterns:

1. **Model-driven architecture**: Relationships and actions are defined on models rather than directly modifying relationships. Use model actions like `Project→assignTouser()` and `Project→addReportViewer()`.

2. **Event-driven activity logging**: Data-changing actions trigger events that write to the activities table for audit purposes.

3. **AI agent pattern**: AI functionality is implemented using LarAgent with specialized tools and chat history management.

4. **Role-based access control**: Permissions are applied via Policies at the model level using the Laratrust library.

## Development environment
The application is run in a Lando development environment using the laravel recipe. Lando features that may be useful:
- `lando start` to start the environment (rarely needed since the environment is usually running)
- `lando artisan` for running Laravel artisan commands
- `lando phpunit` for running PHPUnit tests
- `lando composer` for running Composer commands
- `lando mysql` for accessing the MySQL database

The local site is available at `http://wa-reviews.lndo.site`.

## Database structure
You can find the current schema in the `database/diagram.dbml` file.

### Database entities overview
- **Users**: People who use the application, including admins, reviewers, and viewers.
- **Teams**: Groups of users collaborating on projects.
- **Projects**: Accessibility review projects, each linked to a team.
- **Scopes**: Defined areas or sections within a project.
- **Pages**: Web pages included in a scope for review.
- **Issues**: Accessibility problems identified during reviews.
- **Items**: Specific findings or checks related to issues.
- **Categories, Criteria, Guidelines**: Reference tables for organizing and applying accessibility standards.
- **Assignments & Viewers**: Tables linking users to projects as reviewers or read-only viewers.
- **Team Memberships**: Table linking users to teams.

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.3.23
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/nightwatch (NIGHTWATCH) - v1
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/flux (FLUXUI_FREE) - v2
- livewire/flux-pro (FLUXUI_PRO) - v2
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v3
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4


## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.


=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms


=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- That being said, keys in an Enum should follow existing application Enum conventions.


=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] <name>` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.


=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.


=== fluxui-free/core rules ===

## Flux UI Free

- This project is using the free edition of Flux UI. It has full access to the free components and variants, but does not have access to the Pro components.
- Flux UI is a component library for Livewire. Flux is a robust, hand-crafted, UI component library for your Livewire applications. It's built using Tailwind CSS and provides a set of components that are easy to use and customize.
- You should use Flux UI components when available.
- Fallback to standard Blade components if Flux is unavailable.
- If available, use Laravel Boost's `search-docs` tool to get the exact documentation and code snippets available for this project.
- Flux UI components look like this:

<code-snippet name="Flux UI Component Usage Example" lang="blade">
    <flux:button variant="primary"/>
</code-snippet>


### Available Components
This is correct as of Boost installation, but there may be additional components within the codebase.

<available-flux-components>
avatar, badge, brand, breadcrumbs, button, callout, checkbox, dropdown, field, heading, icon, input, modal, navbar, profile, radio, select, separator, switch, text, textarea, tooltip
</available-flux-components>


=== fluxui-pro/core rules ===

## Flux UI Pro

- This project is using the Pro version of Flux UI. It has full access to the free components and variants, as well as full access to the Pro components and variants.
- Flux UI is a component library for Livewire. Flux is a robust, hand-crafted, UI component library for your Livewire applications. It's built using Tailwind CSS and provides a set of components that are easy to use and customize.
- You should use Flux UI components when available.
- Fallback to standard Blade components if Flux is unavailable.
- If available, use Laravel Boost's `search-docs` tool to get the exact documentation and code snippets available for this project.
- Flux UI components look like this:

<code-snippet name="Flux UI component usage example" lang="blade">
    <flux:button variant="primary"/>
</code-snippet>


### Available Components
This is correct as of Boost installation, but there may be additional components within the codebase.

<available-flux-components>
accordion, autocomplete, avatar, badge, brand, breadcrumbs, button, calendar, callout, card, chart, checkbox, command, context, date-picker, dropdown, editor, field, heading, icon, input, modal, navbar, pagination, popover, profile, radio, select, separator, switch, table, tabs, text, textarea, toast, tooltip
</available-flux-components>


=== livewire/core rules ===

## Livewire Core
- Use the `search-docs` tool to find exact version specific documentation for how to write Livewire & Livewire tests.
- Use the `php artisan make:livewire [Posts\\CreatePost]` artisan command to create new components
- State should live on the server, with the UI reflecting it.
- All Livewire requests hit the Laravel backend, they're like regular HTTP requests. Always validate form data, and run authorization checks in Livewire actions.

## Livewire Best Practices
- Livewire components require a single root element.
- Use `wire:loading` and `wire:dirty` for delightful loading states.
- Add `wire:key` in loops:

    ```blade
    @foreach ($items as $item)
        <div wire:key="item-{{ $item->id }}">
            {{ $item->name }}
        </div>
    @endforeach
    ```

- Prefer lifecycle hooks like `mount()`, `updatedFoo()`) for initialization and reactive side effects:

<code-snippet name="Lifecycle hook examples" lang="php">
    public function mount(User $user) { $this->user = $user; }
    public function updatedSearch() { $this->resetPage(); }
</code-snippet>


## Testing Livewire

<code-snippet name="Example Livewire component test" lang="php">
    Livewire::test(Counter::class)
        ->assertSet('count', 0)
        ->call('increment')
        ->assertSet('count', 1)
        ->assertSee(1)
        ->assertStatus(200);
</code-snippet>


    <code-snippet name="Testing a Livewire component exists within a page" lang="php">
        $this->get('/posts/create')
        ->assertSeeLivewire(CreatePost::class);
    </code-snippet>


=== livewire/v3 rules ===

## Livewire 3

### Key Changes From Livewire 2
- These things changed in Livewire 2, but may not have been updated in this application. Verify this application's setup to ensure you conform with application conventions.
    - Use `wire:model.live` for real-time updates, `wire:model` is now deferred by default.
    - Components now use the `App\Livewire` namespace (not `App\Http\Livewire`).
    - Use `$this->dispatch()` to dispatch events (not `emit` or `dispatchBrowserEvent`).
    - Use the `components.layouts.app` view as the typical layout path (not `layouts.app`).

### New Directives
- `wire:show`, `wire:transition`, `wire:cloak`, `wire:offline`, `wire:target` are available for use. Use the documentation to find usage examples.

### Alpine
- Alpine is now included with Livewire, don't manually include Alpine.js.
- Plugins included with Alpine: persist, intersect, collapse, and focus.

### Lifecycle Hooks
- You can listen for `livewire:init` to hook into Livewire initialization, and `fail.status === 419` for the page expiring:

<code-snippet name="livewire:load example" lang="js">
document.addEventListener('livewire:init', function () {
    Livewire.hook('request', ({ fail }) => {
        if (fail && fail.status === 419) {
            alert('Your session expired');
        }
    });

    Livewire.hook('message.failed', (message, component) => {
        console.error(message);
    });
});
</code-snippet>


=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.


=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind Core

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML, check and use existing tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc..)
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults - remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, group elements logically
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing, don't use margins.

    <code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
        <div class="flex gap-8">
            <div>Superior</div>
            <div>Michigan</div>
            <div>Erie</div>
        </div>
    </code-snippet>


### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.


=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4 - do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff"
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>


### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option - use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated |	Replacement |
|------------+--------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |


=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test` with a specific filename or filter.
