applicability: "This rule applies to any `img`, `canvas` or `svg` element that is visible and for which at least one of the following is true:\n\n- **excluded**: The element is not included in the accessibility tree; or\n- **ignored svg**: The element is an `svg` with an empty (`\"\"`) accessible name and a semantic role of `graphics-document`; or\n- **ignored canvas**: The element is a `canvas` with an empty (`\"\"`) accessible name and no explicit semantic role; or\n\n**Exception**: This rule never applies to elements for which one or more of the following is true:\n\n- The element has an ancestor in the flat tree that is named from author; or\n- The element is an `img` element where the current request's state is not completely available.\n\n**Note**: An example of an image ignored because of an ancestor with named from author is when the image is a descendant of a `button` element that uses `aria-label` for its accessible name."
assumptions: "- `svg` elements with a semantic role of `graphics-document` and with an empty (`\"\"`) accessible name are ignored by assistive technologies tested for this rule. If some assistive technology does not ignore these elements, and that assistive technology is required for conformance, passing this rule does not ensure all decorative `svg` elements can be ignored, and the success criterion 1.1.1 Non-text content may still not be satisfied. The same is true for `canvas` elements with no semantic role and an empty (`\"\"`) accessible name.\n\n- A web page with informative images without an accessible name may conform to WCAG 2.2 Level A when the information provided by that image is available elsewhere on the web page itself. For example if an equivalent text is adjacent to the image, or if the text alternative is included in the accessible name of a parent element."
