    description: "This rule checks that the accessible name of a link describes its purpose.\n"
    accessibility_requirements: { 'wcag20:2.4.9': { forConformance: true, failed: 'not satisfied', passed: 'further testing needed', inapplicable: 'further testing needed' } }
    input_aspects: ['Accessibility Tree', 'DOM Tree', 'CSS Styling', Language]
    acknowledgments: { authors: ['Jean-Yves Moyen'], funding: [WAI-Tools] }
applicability: "This rule applies to any inheriting semantic `link` for which all the following is true:\n\n- the link is included in the accessibility tree; and\n- the link has a non-empty (`\"\"`) accessible name."
assumptions: "- This rule assumes that the purpose of the link is not ambiguous to users in general when seen in context on the web page, which is the exception mentioned in Success Criterion 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only). If the link is ambiguous to users in general, users of assistive technologies are not at a disadvantage when viewing the link out of context.\n- This rule assumes that all semantic `link` elements are used as links. An element marked up as a link, but that does not behave as a link would not fail Success Criterion 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only)."
accessibility_support: '- Implementation of Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some semantic `link` elements can fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue.'
