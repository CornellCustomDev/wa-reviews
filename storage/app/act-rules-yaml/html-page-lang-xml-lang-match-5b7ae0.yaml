    description: "This rule checks that both `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes on the root element of a non-embedded HTML page, have the same primary language subtag.\n"
    accessibility_requirements: { 'wcag20:3.1.1': { forConformance: true, failed: 'not satisfied', passed: 'further testing needed', inapplicable: 'further testing needed' } }
    input_aspects: ['DOM Tree']
    deprecated: "This rule has been deprecated, as modern screen readers no longer use xml:lang when the lang attribute is given, regardless of which MIME type the page is served with. This rule is not maintained anymore and should not be used.\n"

applicability: "This rule applies to any [document element](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#document-element) if it is an `html` element for which all the following are true:\n\n- is in a top-level browsing context; and\n- has a node document](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-document) with a [content type of `text/html`; and\n- has a `lang` attribute with a known primary language tag; and\n- has a non-empty `xml:lang` attribute."
assumptions: "- The language of the page can be set by other methods than the `lang` attribute, for example using HTTP headers or the `meta` element. These methods are not supported by all assistive technologies. This rule assumes that these other methods are insufficient to satisfying [Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#language-of-page).\n\n- This rule assumes that user agents and assistive technologies can programmatically determine known primary language tags even if these do not conform to the RFC 5646 syntax.\n\n- This rule assumes that only known primary language tags are enough to satisfy Success Criterion 3.1.1 Language of Page; this notably excludes grandfathered tags and ISO 639.2 three-letters codes, both having poor support in assistive technologies.\n\n- The rule assumes that having `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes with matching primary language subtags but non-matching language tags](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-2) overall, will not cause accessibility issues. This is not necessarily the case for all languages. One notable case is the [language tags](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-2) for Cantonese (`zh-yue`) and Mandarin (`zh-cmn`) where the [primary language subtags match, but the extended language subtags don't. Such a case would not fail this rule, but could lead to accessibility issues."
accessibility_support: 'Since most assistive technologies will consistently use `lang` over `xml:lang` when both are used, violation of this rule may not necessarily be a violation of WCAG 2. Only when there are inconsistencies between assistive technologies as to which attribute is used to determine the language does this lead to a violation of SC 3.1.1.'
background: "This rule is only applicable to non-embedded HTML pages. HTML pages embedded into other documents, such as through `iframe` or `object` elements are not applicable because they are not [web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-web-page-s) according to the definition in WCAG.\n\n### Bibliography\n\n- [H57: Using language attributes on the html element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H57)\n- [RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html)\n- [The `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes)"
