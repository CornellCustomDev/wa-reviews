    deprecated: 'This rule has been deprecated and superseded by Rule [Image accessible name is descriptive](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/qt1vmo/). This rule is not maintained anymore and should not be used.'
applicability: "This rule applies to any HTML element that is included in the accessibility tree and has a non-empty (`\"\"`) accessible name, for which one of the following is true:\n\n- **img**: the element is an `img` with an accessible name that is equivalent to the filename of at least one of the image sources in its source set; or\n- **input image**: the element is an `input` element in the Image Button state with an accessible name that is equivalent to the filename specified in its `src` attribute.\n\nWhen comparing accessible name and filename, difference in letter casing, leading and trailing whitespace should be ignored."
assumptions: 'There are no assumptions.'
accessibility_support: 'There are no accessibility support issues known.'
background: "It is fairly common for content management systems (CMS) or other tools to default the alt-text of an image to its filename if no alt-text is provided. However, these names are usually not descriptive (often due to the presence of the file extension). This rule uses this heuristic to pinpoint cases where the accessible name should be looked at by human testers. This rule does not automatically decide in which case a filename is correct (notably, it does not automatically decide whether adding the file extension is acceptable).\n\n### Bibliography\n\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content.html)\n- [F30: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 due to using text alternatives that are not alternatives (e.g., filenames or placeholder text)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F30)\n- [G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G94)\n- [G95: Providing short text alternatives that provide a brief description of the non-text content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G95)"
