applicability: 'This rule applies to any semantic `heading` element that is included in the accessibility tree and has a non-empty (`””`) accessible name.'
assumptions: "This rule assumes that the flat tree order is close to the reading order as elements are rendered on the page. Due to positioning, it is possible to render a document in an order that greatly differs from the tree order, in which case the content which is visually associated with a heading might not be the content following it in tree order and this rule might fail while Success Criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Label is still satisfied.\n\nThis rule also assumes that the content the heading is intended to describe is visible and not hidden from assistive technologies. Otherwise, cases such as expandable content using a heading might fail this rule while Success Criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Label is still satisfied."
accessibility_support: 'Implementation of Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some semantic `heading` elements can fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue.'
background: "Headings that are visible but not in the accessibility tree are a failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships. These are not tested by this rule but they can still fail Success Criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Labels.\n\n### Bibliography\n\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html)\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.6: Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html)\n- [G130: Providing descriptive headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G130)\n- [H42: Using h1-h6 to identify headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H42)\n- [ARIA12: Using role=heading to identify headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/aria/ARIA12)\n- [HTML Specification - Heading content](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#heading-content)"
