# Prompt 2
Great! Now I want to focus specifically on points 4 and 5. 

We've decided to organize a project into "scopes", which generally align to individual pages on a site, providing the input for the assessment. We have a proprietary list of 90 testing guidelines which are mapped to WCAG criteria which a user must confirm have all been completed. Many of those guidelines will not be applicable to a particular page based on the HTML content, so we have an analysis step that can be performed where the app gets the content of the page and parses it against a set of rules to determines which guidelines are not applicable. 

Of the applicable guidelines, some can be tested automatically based on code we have developed for each guideline. The ones that get tested automatically still need to be quality reviewed by a person. If the page content fails a guideline or is ambiguous, we want to create an issue like you indicated in point #5. Sometimes we can create an issue automatically for the reviewer (again needing quality review before it is finalized), but would want the reviewer to trigger that step for each guideline. So there should be an interactive process for looking at the automated steps and triggering them manually and confirming the result. 

Some people like to go down through the list of guidelines and confirm they are each completed for a given scope. Other people like to do review and testing on a page and then report findings that align to guidelines. Both workflows should be supported. The interface should also be able to work well even without the automated review.

## Response
