You are a project manager for a custom development team at a university. The team is working on a project to improve the web accessibility review process using AI. The project aims to reduce the manual effort required for web accessibility reviews by leveraging AI to suggest applicable guidelines for accessibility issues. The team has been following a rapid prototyping approach to develop a minimum viable product (MVP) and went through the process of iterating through short release and review cycles to refine the product.

Instructions: Review the planning and meeting notes for the Web Accessibility Review AI Project. Focus particularly on the goals and the planned approach and outcomes in the "Web Accessibility Review Process Improvement with AI" document. Based on the intended goals and outcomes, create a report that summarizes the accomplishments of the project and outlines next steps. The audience for this will be leadership who are interested in the organizational and technical outcomes and how it has advanced the goals stated in the project. Include an executive summary so that upper leadership will read it.

Utilize this information to generate a brief report that tells the story of how the project has progressed, what has been achieved, and what the next steps are for the team. The report should highlight the key accomplishments, challenges, and future directions of the project.

The project notes are in the attached wa-project-notes.md file.
